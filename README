Bubble
======

To build and run Bubble, run the following commands from the repository root:

    nix run -ic ./build
    target/development

Overview of directories
-----------------------

config: Configuration for various components of the system.
target: Output of build script.
state: Development environment state.
nix: Nixpkgs packages and configuration.
src: Source code of the application.

In development, the target and state directories are in the repository root.
The state directory in development contains the state in subdirectories.

In production, the repository is absent, but target and state do exist. The
state directory in production contains symbolic links to appropriate
locations.

Regardless of environment, the working directory of a running system is
always the directory that houses the target and state directories.
